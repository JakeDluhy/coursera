#Coursera Coursework Repository
##Index
I have taken two classes so far.  
1. Algorithms for DNA sequencing, offered by Johns Hopkins  
2. Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part1, offered by Stanford  
##Motivation
I came into software development from Aerospace Engineering, having taken zero Computer Science classes in my University career. I found this lack of experience in classical computer science to be a source of inexperience for me, and I wanted to rectify the problem.
##Running the algorithms
There shouldn't be any problems running the algorithms, except if marked at the beginning of the file with additional instructions. Keep data where it is in order to preserve relative file paths. I run python using the simple python command and the javascript using node.
##Disclaimer
Please, if you are a current student, do not use my work to cheat on your assignments. Remember that coursera is for you to help learn, which will not happen if you do not write your own code. I put it up as a reference, but do not abuse this.
